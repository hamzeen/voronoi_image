voronoi_image
=============
I was quite impressed when I saw the Savannah Project of Daniel Shiffman. A similar output should be possible when a set of voronoi cells (also known as, dirichlet cell) are convoluted with the average color for each of those cells from an underlying image.

I set of thinking, I will have to write my own code to generate a voronoi diagram which sounded good for me for the weekend. However, soon I was pointed to the Voronoi Class which comes bundled with Toxi Libs and I already had installed the library which would make it even better.
